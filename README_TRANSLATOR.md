# Website Translator Implementation

We've successfully implemented the @tilde-nlp/website-translator package in your Next.js application. Here's a summary of what we've done and what you need to do to complete the setup.

## What's Been Implemented

1. **WebsiteTranslator Component**: Created a new component at `src/app/components/WebsiteTranslator.tsx` that loads and initializes the Website Translator widget.

2. **Layout Integration**: Updated the `src/app/layout.tsx` file to include the WebsiteTranslator component.

3. **Environment Variables**: Added environment variables in `.env.local` for the Website Translator API credentials.

4. **Public Directory Setup**: Created a `public/dist` directory and copied the `widget.js` file from the node_modules directory.

5. **Test Page**: Created a test page at `src/app/translator-test/page.tsx` to verify that the Website Translator is working correctly.

6. **Navigation Link**: Added a link to the test page in the Header component.

## What You Need to Do

1. **Update API Credentials**: Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual Website Translator API credentials:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_TRANSLATOR_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_TRANSLATOR_API_URL=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_URL
   ```

2. **Verify Widget.js**: Make sure the `widget.js` file is correctly placed in the `public/dist` directory. If not, you can copy it manually from:

   ```
   node_modules/@tilde-nlp/website-translator/dist/widget.js
   ```

   to:

   ```
   public/dist/widget.js
   ```

3. **Test the Implementation**: Start your development server and navigate to the test page to verify that the Website Translator is working correctly:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then visit: http://localhost:3000/translator-test

## Customization Options

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the translator by modifying the options in the `WebsiteTranslator.tsx` component:

- `toolbarPosition`: Where the toolbar appears ("top", "bottom", etc.)
- `layout`: How the language selector is displayed ("menu" for dropdown, "list" for buttons)
- `translate`: Whether to display UI in the target language ("target") or source language ("source")
